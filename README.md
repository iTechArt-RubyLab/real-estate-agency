* The most difficult task
There are no difficult tasks in my project, it's not problematic to figure out how to work with one or another gem. 
The most difficult thing was to correctly prioritize and allocate time. 
It was also tight to acquire the skill to look for errors and refactor the code.

* The most interesting task
The project in general was interesting, deploying and creating something from scratch is very exciting, 
and then filling it with new functionality, trying to use different implementations and gems. 
The most interesting part deal with shared examples and factory bot and writing a lot of tests with these tools 
and was adding profiles to the device user because it was the longest and most difficult task.

* What could be done if there was more time
If I had more time, I would certainly practice in react or angular and rewrite the project using these tools. 
I would like to improve the asignee-asigner-client system and the definition of statuses using the kanban board. 
It's also better to deal with the policy and make a quality role-playing system. 
Also, I would also like to deal with rspec and make more universal general examples 
and study the capabilities of the factory bot in more detail. 
Add registration of the lot by the client and display the orders placed for his lots to the selected realtor. 
Better deal with background jobs and add csv reports.
