    quote1: The light is what guides you home, the warmth is what keeps you there.
    author1: Ellie Rodriguez.
    quote2: Just an hour away from most major cities, you can always find affordable real estate. You need to find an area that is growing in value, and over time, the property will fall under revaluation. By the time you retire, these three houses will be generating a steady incomeâ€”much more reliable than a mutual fund.
    author2: Robert Kiyosaki.
    book2: Rich dad, poor dad.
    quote3: In a cramped apartment, even thoughts are cramped.
    author3: Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky.
